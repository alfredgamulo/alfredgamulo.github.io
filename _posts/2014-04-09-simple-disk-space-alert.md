We had a need to get alerts in case we are close to running out of disk space on multiple servers but we didnâ€™t want to over complicate it with heavy processes and monitoring. My solution:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
CURRENT=$(df /u01 | grep /u01 | awk '{ print $4}' | sed 's/%//g')
THRESHOLD=1000000
TO=\
user1@example.com \
user2@example.com

if [ "$CURRENT" -lt "$THRESHOLD" ] ; then
mail -s 'Disk Space Alert' $TO << EOF
/u01 partition is running low on disk space. $CURRENT bytes left.
EOF
{% endhighlight %}

Drop that bad boy in /etc/cron.hourly and you got yourself a heartbeat baby!
