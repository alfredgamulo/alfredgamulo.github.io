A little while ago, my then existing file server went kaput. The main OS drive was beginning to fail and boot-ups would take several attempts. The pool was also beginning to show wear and tear as executing a ‘zpool status’ would reflect nothing but ‘DEGRADED’ drives. On top of that, the case I had purchased was just awful. NEVER BUY XClio. They suck. Don’t do it. Stop reading this if you like XClio.

So, naturally, I hit up Amazon & Newegg to shop around for new parts. How exciting! After some time shopping and reading reviews I told myself to take a step back and really evaluate what I wanted out of this machine. On my old machine, everything was slow to boot and on top of that, the memory I bought was incompatible to the motherboard so booting became quite the hassle as I had to intercept the boot sequence every time a restart was necessary. So step 1 was ensuring that whatever parts I get, I better make sure they all work together perfectly.

As I thought about what type of machine I wanted to build, I reflected on times where I would have friends come over and how I needed to use my XBox or laptop to play Netflix or any downloaded shows. Step 2 was a game changer – I needed to build a server that would double as a home theater and on top of that it needs to be Windows because Netflix and Microsoft love each other. Since this machine will be on all the time, and since I’m a big boy now and have to pay big boy money to big boy electric companies… Step 3 was to build the machine to be as energy efficient as I can.

The following Amazon widget isn’t an ad, so don’t skip over it. Peruse it with all your might. Seriously, look at it. Mouseover the objects. Get an understanding for the prices, the star ratings, or not I don’t care.
PHEW! Ok, now that you’ve read over my selection of parts, we can move on to the quiz. What? You didn’t know there was a quiz and you aren’t ready? That’s ok, you can bribe me with a little donation.

Sooo, first things first. The case! I chose this case because it looks BADASS. Look at it. It’s black and white and looks like a pwn-your-face stormtrooper. Squint your eyes, you’ll see it. This case is a mini-ITX case which is the smallest case you can get that will fit a shit load of drives. The reason we chose this case is because we want a file server, but we don’t want the wifey nagging me about the ugly glowing alien machine in the corner. This kickass case is small, quiet, and delicious eye candy.

For the power supply, the one I picked out was the only one that would fit the tiny case. It has all the right power cables, and can be easily tucked in and won’t be all octopussing all over inside. At 500w, you’ll be good to go with this mofo.

Next step is to choose a motherboard. Not a big selection, but the one I chose is the best money can buy. “But Alf it only has two SATA ports…” SHUTTHEFUCKUP I’ll get to that in a bit! This motherboard is small, it fits 2 memory sticks, 1 PCI slot, but best of all it has HDMI output. That’s right ladies, I’ve got a high definition media interface No messing around with a bunch of cables, just plug that bad boy into the receiver, sit back, relax, get a back massage, and accidentally fall asleep before sexy times.

I don’t have much to say about the processor and memory. Before I started shopping around I didn’t even know Intel still made Pentiums. Apparently they do. And apparently they are very affordable and I don’t need any heavy processing anyway. The memory is meh. It’s memory. Next.

Now for my OS drive. BAM! SSD baby. We’re going with an SSD because we want fast boot times. On top of that SSDs are quiet as shit and if you remember step 4 above, we want to run this thing as quietly as possible so the ol’ missus doesn’t come a-hollerin when I’m up late playing Microsoft Pinball. For the SSD, we picked OCZ. OCZ is the best SSD maker. If you disagree, come at me bro.

We’re gonna need a disk drive. Some people still haven’t heard of the Internet. Some people have also never heard of USB sticks either, go figure. If you’re smart, you’ll get a dvd burning Blu-ray drive like me. If you’re dumb, why are you reading this? We want a Blu-ray drive because sometimes the wife may come home after buying me some more beer and happened to stop by a redbox and picked up some chick flick I promised that we’d watch . Jokes, I love chick flicks, and they better be in hi-def.

Time for the important stuff. I got this affordable software RAID controller by Syba. Disregard the “software RAID” part. It doesn’t matter. In fact, we’re going to flash the BIOS so that it’ll behave like a plain old card with 4 SATA ports. As for the drives, I picked out 4 2TB Western Digital Green drives. 2TB is phat nasty. When we’re all done, that will give us 5 and some change terabytes of storage to work with. Think of the porn! The green part means that its more efficient or something. I don’t know the specifics, let’s just build this thing already!

The last thing we need is an operating system. We’re limited to Windows because of our requirement to play both Netflix and Blu-ray movies. On top of that, Windows 8 is kind of sexy. You can go with Windows 8 Pro as listed above, but you’d be a chump. I suggest getting Windows Server 2012. Don’t be cheap, we’re building a SERVER. Just kidding, I’m cheap as hell!
