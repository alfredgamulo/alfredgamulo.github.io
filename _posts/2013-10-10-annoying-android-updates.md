Have you rooted and modified your Android phone? Are the vendor-pushed updates getting annoying? Follow this guide to silence those updates and be in control of your own upgrades:

Step 0: Be root.

{% highlight Bash shell scripts %}
su
{% endhighlight %}


Step 1: Mount the /system folder as read/write.

{% highlight Bash shell scripts %}
mount -o remount,rw /system
{% endhighlight %}

Step 2: Create a shitty apps folder.

{% highlight Bash shell scripts %}
cd /system
mkdir app_hell
{% endhighlight %}

Step 3: Move the shitty app (In this case, weâ€™re moving the firmware upgrade app).

{% highlight Bash shell scripts %}
mv app/FWUpgrade.apk app_hell/. 
mv app/FWUpgrade.odex app_hell/.
{% endhighlight %}

Step 4: Remount the /system folder back to read-only.

{% highlight Bash shell scripts %}
mount -o remount,ro /system
{% endhighlight %}

Step 5: Drink a beer.
